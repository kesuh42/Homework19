# Homework19: User Directory
This application allows the user to manage a given set of users. For demonstration purposes, a random array of employees is used. The html page generates a table of users with their information based on the array passed in. The buttons at the bottom allow the user to manipulate the data, either filtering by gender or sorting by last name.
